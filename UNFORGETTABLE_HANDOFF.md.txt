## 🎨 BRAND IDENTITY: FORTEEN STUDIOS

### **Company Evolution:**
- **Old:** Forteen Consulting (service provider)
- **New:** Forteen Studios (content creator)

### **Why "Studios":**
Positions as premium content creator (like Netflix, Apple TV) rather than training vendor. Justifies premium pricing and opens licensing/partnership opportunities.

### **Tagline:**
"Where Professionals Become Unforgettable"

### **Series Name:**
UNFORGETTABLE (not "The Presence Premium")

### **Pilot Name:**
The Spotlight Test
